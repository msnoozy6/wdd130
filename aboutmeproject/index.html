</body> Hi everyone, my name is Madelynn and I’m from Ridgefield, Washington. I’m currently pursuing my Bachelors degree in Web Development and Design. I heard web development jobs are on the rise and most are remote. I want to have children one day so I hope to have a career in web development where I can work form home. I also would like the opportunity to travel which a remote career would best suit that.
<p>I’m a very adventurous and outdoorsy person. My hobbies include horse riding, hiking, kayaking, snowboarding, swimming, skydiving, and bungee jumping. I hope to learn how to surf and rock climb soon! Currently my profession is a dog walker and a Certified Nursing Assistant. 
     </p>I’ve been lucky enough to grow up in the church my whole life. I love learning at BYU-Idaho since it allows me to work with amazing professors and fellow classmates. I also have the opportunity to strengthen my testimony and combine education and religion which helps me to learn to the best of my ability. <p>

     </p>
